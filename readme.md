# My leetcode sandbox

This is the project I use for all leetcode stuff. Mainly, I use Codewars and
Grokking Algorithms.

## Reasons for having a single dedicated project for leetcode

- Having several projects for leetcode is cumbersome. During the studying
  sessions, I may use several sources for finding problems, and jumping from
  project to project isn't really convenient.

- Having everything related to leetcode, keeping all the tasks, solutions,
  examples in one place is helpful.

- Seeing achievements pile up is satisfying.
